   :tagline: Compress strings to shrink logs by +75%
   :status: stable
   :languages: C11, Python, Rust, TypeScript
   :code-size-impact: 50% reduction in binary log size

Logging is critical, but developers are often forced to choose between
additional logging or saving crucial flash space. The ``pw_tokenizer`` module
enables **extensive logging with substantially less memory usage** by replacing
printf-style strings with binary tokens during compilation. It is designed to
integrate easily into existing logging systems.

Although the most common application of ``pw_tokenizer`` is binary logging,
**the tokenizer is general purpose and can be used to tokenize any strings**,
with or without printf-style arguments.

Why tokenize strings?

* **Dramatically reduce binary size** by removing string literals from binaries.
* **Reduce I/O traffic, RAM, and flash usage** by sending and storing compact tokens
  instead of strings. We've seen over 50% reduction in encoded log contents.
* **Reduce CPU usage** by replacing snprintf calls with simple tokenization code.
* **Remove potentially sensitive log, assert, and other strings** from binaries.

Tokenized logging in action

Here's an example of how ``pw_tokenizer`` enables you to store
and send the same logging information using significantly less
resources:

A quick overview of how the tokenized version works:

* You tokenize ``"Battery Voltage: %d mV"`` with a macro like
  :c:macro:`PW_TOKENIZE_STRING`. You can use :ref:`module-pw_log_tokenized`
  to handle the tokenization automatically.
* After tokenization, ``"Battery Voltage: %d mV"`` becomes ``d9 28 47 8e``.
* The first 4 bytes sent over the wire is the tokenized version of
  ``"Battery Voltage: %d mV"``. The last 2 bytes are the value of ``voltage``
  converted to a varint using :ref:`module-pw_varint`.
* The logs are converted back to the original, human-readable message
  via the :ref:`Detokenization API <module-pw_tokenizer-detokenization>`
  and a :ref:`token database <module-pw_tokenizer-token-databases>`.
