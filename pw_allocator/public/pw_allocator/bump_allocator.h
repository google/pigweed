/// Allocator that does not automatically delete.

/// A "bump" or "arena" allocator provides memory by simply incrementing a
/// pointer to a memory region in order to "allocate" memory for requests, and
/// doing nothing on deallocation. All memory is freed only when the allocator
/// itself is destroyed. As a result, this allocator is extremely fast.
///
/// Bump allocators are useful when short-lived to allocate objects from small
/// buffers with almost zero overhead. Since memory is not deallocated, a bump
/// allocator with a longer lifespan than any of its allocations will end up
/// holding unusable memory. An example of a good use case might be decoding
/// RPC messages that may require a variable amount of space only for as long as
/// it takes to decode a single message.
///
/// On destruction, the destructors for any objects allocated using `New` or
/// `MakeUnique` are NOT called. To have these destructors invoked, you can
/// allocate "owned" objects using `NewOwned` and `MakeUniqueOwned`. This adds a
/// small amount of overhead to the allocation.
