reStructuredText style guide
============================
.. inclusive-language: disable
.. _reStructuredText: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html
.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
.. inclusive-language: enable

This style guide defines Pigweed's conventions for `reStructuredText`_ (reST).
``pigweed.dev`` documentation is authored in reST, not Markdown. Pigweed
uses `Sphinx`_ to convert reST into HTML.

.. tip:: ``pw format`` detects reST style issues.

.. _docs-style-rest-overview:

--------
Overview
--------

.. _docs-style-rest-scope:

Scope
=====
This style guide applies to all reST markup that's intended to be published to
``pigweed.dev``. reST markup is mainly found in ``.rst`` files but it's also
possible to embed reST within other types of files.

.. _docs-style-rest-other:

Related style guides
====================
This style guide is narrowly focused on Pigweed's usage of reStructuredText.
See :ref:`docs-contrib-docs` for other aspects of Pigweed documentation style.

.. _docs-style-rest-headings:

--------
Headings
--------
Use the following syntax for headings.

.. code-block:: rst

   ==================
   H1: Document title
   ==================
   In HTML the heading above is rendered as an H1 node. A page must have
   exactly one H1 node. The H1 text must have equals signs (``=``) above
   and below it.

   ------------
   H2: Sections
   ------------
   In HTML the heading above is rendered as an H2 node. The H2 text must have
   minus signs (``-``) above and below it. H2 headings are conceptually similar
   to chapters in a book.

   H3: Subsections
   ===============
   In HTML the heading above is rendered as an H3 node. The H3 text must
   have equals signs (``=``) below it. H3 headings are conceptually similar to
   sections within a chapter of a book.

   H4: Subsubsections
   ------------------
   In HTML the heading above is rendered as an H4 node. The H4 text must have
   minus signs (``-``) below it. H4 headings are used rarely.

   H5: Subsubsubsections
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   In HTML the heading above is rendered as an H5 node. The H5 text must have
   caret symbols (``^``) below it. H5 headings are used very rarely.

   H6: Subsubsubsubsections
   ........................
   In HTML the heading above is rendered as an H6 node. The H6 text must have
   period symbols (``.``) below it. H6 headings are practically never used and
   are an indicator that a document probably needs refactoring.

.. _docs-style-rest-headings-order:

Heading levels
==============
Headings must be used in hierarchical order. No level can be skipped. For
example, you can't use an H1 heading followed by an H3. See
`Headings and titles <https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility#headings-and-titles>`_.

.. _docs-style-rest-headings-whitespace-after:

No blank lines after headings
=============================
Don't put whitespace between a heading and the content that follows it.

.. admonition:: **Yes**
   :class: checkmark

   .. code-block:: rst

      Example heading
      ===============
      This paragraph is positioned correctly.

.. admonition:: **No**
   :class: error

   .. code-block:: rst

      Example heading
      ===============

      This paragraph isn't positioned correctly. There shouldn't be a blank
      line above it.

.. _docs-style-rest-headings-whitespace-before:

One blank line before a heading
===============================
Put one blank line between a heading and the content that comes before it.

.. admonition:: **Yes**
   :class: checkmark

   .. code-block:: rst

      This paragraph is positioned correctly.

      Example heading
      ---------------
      ...

.. admonition:: **No**
   :class: error

   .. code-block:: rst

      This paragraph isn't positioned correctly. There's too much whitespace
      below it.



      Example heading
      ---------------
      ...

.. _docs-style-rest-directives:

----------
Directives
----------
Indent directive content and attributes 3 spaces so that they align
with the directive name.

.. admonition:: **Yes**
   :class: checkmark

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. my-directive::
         :my-attr: This attribute is positioned correctly.

         This paragraph is positioned correctly.

         .. my-nested-directive::

            This paragraph is positioned correctly.

.. admonition:: **No**
   :class: error

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. my-directive::

        This paragraph isn't positioned correctly. It has too few spaces.

      .. my-directive::

          This paragraph isn't positioned correctly. It has too many spaces.

Put a blank line between the directive and its content. Don't put space
between a directive name and its attributes.

.. admonition:: **Yes**
   :class: checkmark

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. my-directive::
         :my-attr: This attribute is positioned correctly.

         This paragraph is positioned correctly.

.. admonition:: **No**
   :class: error

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. my-directive::
         This paragraph isn't positioned correctly. There should be a blank
         line above it.

.. _docs-style-rest-tables:

------
Tables
------
.. _csv-table: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#csv-table-1
.. _list-table: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#list-table
.. _table: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#table

Prefer `list-table`_ and `csv-table`_. Avoid `table`_. ``list-table`` and
``csv-table`` are easier to maintain.

.. _docs-style-rest-includes:

-------------
Code includes
-------------
Prefer including code snippets from actual source code files that are built
and tested regularly.

To include a portion of a file:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. literalinclude:: my_source_file.py
      :start-after: my-start-text
      :end-before: my-end-text

``my-start-text`` and ``my-end-text`` are the exclusive delimiters that must
appear verbatim in the source file.

.. _docs-style-rest-includes-python:

Python code includes
====================
.. inclusive-language: disable
.. _autodoc: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html#directives
.. inclusive-language: enable

Use `autodoc`_.

Python code includes for CLI args
---------------------------------
Use `argparse <https://sphinx-argparse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_.

.. _docs-style-rest-code-blocks:

-----------
Code blocks
-----------
.. _Languages: https://pygments.org/languages/
.. inclusive-language: disable
.. _code-block: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-code-block
.. inclusive-language: enable

Use `code-block`_. See `Languages`_ for the list of valid language
keywords.

If Google has a style guide for the programming language in your code block,
your code should match Google's style guide.

.. code-block:: rst

   .. code-block:: c++

      // ...

.. _docs-style-rest-code-blocks-shell:

Code blocks for CLI interactions
================================
Use ``.. code-block:: shell`` for Bash scripts and
``.. code-block:: fish`` for Fish scripts.

.. _docs-style-rest-code-blocks-console:

Code blocks for CLI interactions
================================
.. _console: https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/#pygments.lexers.shell.BashSessionLexer

Use ``.. code-block:: console`` for UNIX CLI interactions and
``.. code-block:: doscon`` for DOS CLI interactions.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Linux and macOS

      Use ``.. code-block:: console``.

      Use the ``$`` starting prompt if the command can be run with
      normal user privileges. Use ``#`` if the command requires root
      privileges. These prompts are required because they help Pygments
      parse the code correctly.

      Continue a command on another line with ``\\``. Start the
      continuation lines with ``>``.

      .. code-block:: text

         .. code-block:: console

            $ ls -a
            .  ..  a  b  c
            $ echo \
            > test
            test
            $ su
            # ls -a
            .  ..  a  b  c

   .. tab-item:: Windows

      Use ``.. code-block:: doscon``.

      Use the ``>`` starting prompt. This prompt helps Pygments
      parse the code correctly.

      Continue a command on another line with ``^``. Start the
      continuation lines with ``More?``.

      .. code-block:: text

         .. code-block:: doscon

            > copy ^
            More? source.txt ^
            destination.txt

.. _docs-style-rest-toc:

-------------------------------------
Table of contents depth customization
-------------------------------------
Put ``:tocdepth: X`` on the first line of the page, where ``X`` equals how many
levels of section heading you want to show in the page's table of contents. See
``//docs/sphinx/changelog.rst`` for an example.

.. _docs-style-rest-cta:

----------------------
Call-to-action buttons
----------------------
Use ``grid`` and ``grid-item-card``.

.. code-block::

   .. grid:: 2

      .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`<ICON>` <TITLE>
         :link: <REF>
         :link-type: <TYPE>
         :class-item: <CLASS>

         <DESCRIPTION>

.. _Octicons: https://primer.style/foundations/icons
.. inclusive-language: disable
.. _ref: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/referencing.html#ref-role
.. inclusive-language: enable

* See `Octicons`_ for the list of valid ``<ICON>`` values.
* ``<REF>`` can either be a `ref`_ or a full URL.
* ``<TYPE>`` must be either ``ref`` or ``url``.
* ``<CLASS>`` must be either ``sales-pitch-cta-primary`` or
  ``sales-pitch-cta-secondary``. The top-left or top card should use
  ``sales-pitch-cta-primary``; all the others should use
  ``sales-pitch-cta-secondary``. The motivation is to draw extra attention to
  the primary card.
* ``<DESCRIPTION>`` should be reStructuredText describing what kind of
  content you'll see if you click the card.

.. _docs-style-rest-tabs:

----
Tabs
----
.. _Tabs: https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/furo-theme/tabs.html

Use ``tab-set`` and ``tab-item``. See `Tabs`_.

.. code-block:: rst

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Linux

         Linux instructions...

      .. tab-item:: Windows

         Windows instructions...

Rendered output:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Linux

      Linux instructions...

   .. tab-item:: Windows

      Windows instructions...

.. _docs-style-rest-tabs-code:

Tabs for code-only content
==========================
Use ``tab-set-code``. See `Languages`_ for the list of
valid language keywords.

.. code-block:: rst

   .. tab-set-code::

      .. code-block:: c++

         // C++ code...

      .. code-block:: python

         # Python code...

Rendered output:

.. tab-set-code::

   .. code-block:: c++

      // C++ code...

   .. code-block:: python

      # Python code...

.. _docs-style-rest-tabs-sync:

Tab synchronization
===================
Use the ``:sync:`` attribute to synchronize tabs for non-code content. See
**Rendered output** below for an example.

``tab-set-code`` tabs automatically synchronize by code language.

.. code-block:: rst

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Linux
         :sync: linux

         Linux instructions...

      .. tab-item:: Windows
         :sync: windows

         Windows instructions...

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Linux
         :sync: linux

         More Linux instructions...

      .. tab-item:: Windows
         :sync: windows

         More Windows instructions...

Rendered output:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Linux
      :sync: linux

      Linux instructions...

   .. tab-item:: Windows
      :sync: windows

      Windows instructions...

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Linux
      :sync: linux

.. _docs-style-rest-cs:

----------------
CodeSearch links
----------------
To link to a file, directory, or commit on
``cs.opensource.google/pigweed/pigweed``, use our custom ``:cs:`` role.

The ``:cs:`` role is implemented here: :cs:`docs/sphinx/_extensions/cs.py`

Link to a tip-of-tree file or directory
=======================================
.. code-block:: rst

   :cs:`{path}`

Where ``{path}`` is the path to the file or directory, relative to the root of
the upstream Pigweed repository.

For example, the following code:

.. code-block:: rst

   :cs:`pw_allocator/allocator.cc`

Renders like this: :cs:`pw_allocator/allocator.cc`

Link to a file or directory at a specific commit
================================================
.. code-block:: rst

   :cs:`{text} <{commit}:{path}>`

Where ``{text}`` is the link text that will be displayed, ``{commit}`` is the
full commit SHA, and ``{path}`` is the path to the file.

For example, the following code:

.. code-block:: rst

   :cs:`pw_allocator/allocator.cc <a18dd872b2c6fd544f96b38b31aafca6b4a0fa7b:pw_allocator/allocator.cc>`

Renders like this: :cs:`pw_allocator/allocator.cc
<a18dd872b2c6fd544f96b38b31aafca6b4a0fa7b:pw_allocator/allocator.cc>`

Link to a commit
================
.. code-block:: rst

   :cs:`{text} <{commit}>`

Where ``{text}`` is the link text that will be displayed, and ``{commit}`` is
the full commit SHA.

For example, the following code:

.. code-block:: rst

   :cs:`my commit <a18dd872b2c6fd544f96b38b31aafca6b4a0fa7b>`

Renders like this: :cs:`my commit <a18dd872b2c6fd544f96b38b31aafca6b4a0fa7b>`

Link to a specific line within a file
=====================================
.. code-block:: rst

   :cs:`{text} <{commit}:{path};l={number}>`

Where ``{text}`` is the link text that will be displayed, ``{commit}`` is the
full commit SHA, ``{path}`` is the path to the file, and ``{number}`` is the
line that you want to link to.

For example, the following code:

.. code-block:: rst

   :cs:`my line <a18dd872b2c6fd544f96b38b31aafca6b4a0fa7b:pw_allocator/allocator.cc;l=22>`

Renders like this: :cs:`my line
<a18dd872b2c6fd544f96b38b31aafca6b4a0fa7b:pw_allocator/allocator.cc;l=22>`

Line 22 containing the following text should be highlighted:

.. code-block:: cpp

   using ::pw::allocator::Layout;

.. note::

   You can use ``main`` for the ``{commit}`` value if you want to link to the
   file at tip-of-tree, but as the file changes over time, the link may
   eventually point to a different line than what you intended.

.. _docs-style-rest-doxylink:

-----------------------
Sphinx-to-Doxygen links
-----------------------
When you'd like to link to a Doxygen page from within the Sphinx docs,
use the ``:cc:`` role, which is powered by `Doxylink`_.

Unqualified names
=================
Direct links to unqualified names are never allowed:

.. code-block:: rst

   :cc:`PendRead`

If multiple symbols named ``PendRead`` exist in different namespaces,
`Doxylink`_ must guess at what particular ``PendRead`` it should link to.

Symbols in the pw namespace
===========================
For symbols in the ``pw`` namespace (e.g. ``pw::Status``) always use
the fully qualified name:

.. code-block:: rst

   :cc:`pw::IntrusiveList``

Symbols with two or more levels of namespace
============================================
When referring to a symbol within the same namespace, display the unqualified
name. When referring to a symbol from another namespace, use the minimal
amount of namespacing that's required to disambiguate the namespace. The
underlying link to the symbol must always be fully namespaced.

For example, when linking to a ``pw_channel`` symbol from within the
``pw_channel`` docs, do this:

.. code-block:: rst

   :cc:`PendRead <pw::channel::AnyChannel::PendRead>`

But when referring to that same symbol from another module's docs, do this:

.. code-block:: rst

   :cc:`channel::AnyChannel::PendRead <pw::channel::AnyChannel::PendRead>`

.. _Doxylink: https://sphinxcontrib-doxylink.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
