Who's using Pigweed?
--------------------
Pigweed has shipped on millions of devices.

--------------------
Showcase: pw_console
--------------------
:ref:`module-pw_console` is our multi-purpose, pluggable REPL and log viewer.
It's designed to be a complete development and manufacturing solution for
interacting with hardware devices via :ref:`module-pw_rpc` over a
:ref:`module-pw_hdlc` transport. Gone are the days of hacking together a REPL
and log viewer for each new project!
