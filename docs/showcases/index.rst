      Check out Sense to see the best of Pigweed in action. In this
      tutorial you'll see hermetic building, flashing, and testing
      with Bazel, authoring in Visual Studio Code with full C++ code
      intelligence, viewing logs and sending commands via pw_console,
      and more. If you like what you see, you're welcome to clone
      the project and start building your own products on top of the
      foundations that Sense demonstrates.
