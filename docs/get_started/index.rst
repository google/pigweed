Configure your workstation for Pigweed development
--------------------------------------------------
Pigweed does its best to bundle all its dependencies into an isolated
environment using :ref:`module-pw_env_setup`. While this doesn't eliminate
all prerequisites, it greatly accelerates new developer onboarding.

The first-time setup guides below are required for any Pigweed-based project,
but only need to be done once per machine.

      :class-item: sales-pitch-cta-primary

      Explore key Pigweed features, such as hermetic building, full C++
      code intelligence in VS Code, communicating with devices over RPC,
      host-side and on-device unit tests, and lots more.

      :link: https://cs.opensource.google/pigweed/quickstart/bazel
      :link-type: url
      :class-item: sales-pitch-cta-secondary

      Fork our minimal, Bazel-based starter project to create a new
      Pigweed project from scratch. The project includes a basic
      blinky LED program that runs on Raspberry Pi Picos and can
      be simulated on your development host.

      :link: docs-quickstart-zephyr
      :link-type: ref
      :class-item: sales-pitch-cta-secondary

      Learn how to set up a C++-based Zephyr project that is ready to use
      Pigweed and then build the app with Zephyr's ``native_sim`` board.

      Check out the examples repo, a repository that outlines the recommended
      way to use Pigweed in a broader GN-based project. Note that Bazel is the
      recommended build system for new projects using Pigweed, whereas the
      examples repo uses GN.
