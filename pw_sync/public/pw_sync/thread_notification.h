// The ThreadNotification is a synchronization primitive that can be used to
// permit a SINGLE thread to block and consume a latching, saturating
// notification from multiple notifiers.
//
// IMPORTANT: This is a single consumer/waiter, multiple producer/notifier API!
// The acquire APIs must only be invoked by a single consuming thread. As a
// result, having multiple threads receiving notifications via the acquire API
// is unsupported.
//
// This is effectively a subset of a binary semaphore API, except that only a
// single thread can be notified and block at a time.
//
// The single consumer aspect of the API permits the use of a smaller and/or
// faster native APIs such as direct thread signaling.
//
// The ThreadNotification is initialized to being empty (latch is not set).
