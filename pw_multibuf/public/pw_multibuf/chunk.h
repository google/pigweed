/// communication protocols which want to reserve space at the front or rear of
/// a buffer for headers or footers.
///
/// In order to support zero-copy DMA of communications buffers, allocators can
/// create properly-aligned ``Chunk`` regions in appropriate memory. The driver
/// can then ``DiscardPrefix`` in order to reserve bytes for headers,
/// ``Truncate`` in order to reserve bytes for footers, and then pass the
/// ``Chunk`` to the user to fill in. The header and footer space can then
/// be reclaimed using the ``ClaimPrefix`` and ``ClaimSuffix`` methods.
