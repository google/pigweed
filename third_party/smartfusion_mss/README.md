# LiberoSoC Library

The folder provides build scripts and configuration recipes for building
the SmartFusion2 Microcontroller Subsystem library. The source code needs to be downloaded by the user, or
via the support in pw_package "pw package install sf2mss". For gn build,
set `dir_pw_third_party_smartfusion_mss` to point to the path of the source code.
