"""Facilitates automating unit tests on devices with serial ports.

This library assumes that the on-device test runner emits the test results
as plain-text over a serial port, and that tests are triggered by a pre-defined
input (``DEFAULT_TEST_START_CHARACTER``) over the same serial port that results
are emitted from.
