/// Collects and processes the results of a unit test run. Its interface is
/// called by the unit test framework as tests are executed and various test
/// events occur.
///
/// A program wanting to process test events must define a class implementing
/// the ``pw::unit_test::EventHandler`` interface and register it with the
/// framework. When ``RUN_ALL_TESTS()`` is called, ``pw_unit_test`` notifies
/// the handler of various events which occur in the test process.
/// For example, consider a file containing the following test definitions:
///
/// @code{.cpp}
///   TEST(MyTestSuite, MyFirstCase) {
///     EXPECT_TRUE(true);
///   }
///
///   TEST(MyTestSuite, MySecondCase) {
///     EXPECT_TRUE(false);
///   }
/// @endcode
///
/// There's one test suite consisting of two test cases. When ``pw_unit_test``
/// starts running the first test case (``MyFirstCase``), it dispatches a
/// ``TestCaseStart`` event to the event handler. It then runs the body of the
/// test, sequentially checking each expectation within. After each expectation,
/// a
/// ``TestCaseExpect`` event is sent to the event handler with the expectation's
/// result. In this case, there's only one, which passes successfully. Finally,
/// after the test is finished, a ``TestCaseEnd`` event is dispatched with the
/// overall result of the test case. ``pw_unit_test`` then runs ``MySecondCase``
/// in the same way.
