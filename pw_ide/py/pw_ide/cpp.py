"""Configure C/C++ IDE support for Pigweed projects.

We support C/C++ code analysis via ``clangd``, or other language servers that
are compatible with the ``clangd`` compilation database format.

While clangd can work well out of the box for typical C++ codebases, some work
is required to coax it to work for embedded projects. In particular, Pigweed
projects use multiple toolchains within a distinct environment, and almost
always define multiple targets. This means compilation units are likely have
multiple compile commands and the toolchain executables are unlikely to be in
your path. ``clangd`` is not equipped to deal with this out of the box. We
handle this by:

- Processing the compilation database produced by the build system into
  multiple internally-consistent compilation databases, one for each target
  (where a "target" is a particular build for a particular system using a
  particular toolchain).

- Creating unambiguous paths to toolchain drivers to ensure the right toolchain
  is used and that clangd knows where to find that toolchain's system headers.

- Providing tools for working with several compilation databases that are
  spiritually similar to tools like ``pyenv``, ``rbenv``, etc.

In short, we take the probably-broken compilation database that the build system
generates, process it into several not-broken compilation databases in the
``pw_ide`` working directory, and provide a stable symlink that points to the
selected active target's compliation database. If ``clangd`` is configured to
point at the symlink and is set up with the right paths, you'll get code
intelligence.

    """Return the path to a compiler executable.

    In a ``clang`` compile command, the executable may or may not include a
    path. For example:

    .. code-block:: none

       /usr/bin/clang      <- includes a path
       ../path/to/my/clang <- includes a path
       clang               <- doesn't include a path

    If it includes a path, then ``clangd`` will have no problem finding the
    driver, so we can simply return the path. If the executable *doesn't*
    include a path, then ``clangd`` will search ``$PATH``, and may not find the
    intended driver unless you actually want the default system toolchain or
    Pigweed paths have been added to ``$PATH``. So this function provides two
    options for resolving those ambiguous paths:

    - Provide a default path, and all executables without a path will be
      re-written with a path within the default path.
    - Provide the a set of globs that will be used to search for the executable,
      which will normally be the query driver globs used with clangd.

    By default, if neither of these options is chosen, or if the executable
    cannot be found within the provided globs, the pathless executable that was
    provided will be returned, and clangd will resort to searching $PATH. If you
    instead pass ``strict=True``, this will raise an exception if an unambiguous
    path cannot be constructed.

    This function only tries to ensure that all executables have a path to
    eliminate ambiguity. A couple of important things to keep in mind:

    - This doesn't guarantee that the path exists or an executable actually
      exists at the path. It only ensures that some path is provided to an
      executable.
    - An executable being present at the indicated path doesn't guarantee that
      it will work flawlessly for clangd code analysis. The clangd
      ``--query-driver`` argument needs to include a path to this executable in
      order for its bundled headers to be resolved correctly.

    This function also filters out invalid or unsupported drivers. For example,
    build systems will sometimes naively include build steps for Python or other
    languages in the compilation database, which are not usable with clangd.
    As a result, this function has four possible end states:

    - It returns a path with an executable that can be used as a ``clangd``
      driver.
    - It returns ``None``, meaning the compile command was invalid.
    - It returns the same string that was provided (as a ``Path``), if a path
      couldn't be resolved and ``strict=False``.
    - It raises an ``UnresolvablePathException`` if the executable cannot be
      placed in an unambiguous path and ``strict=True``.

        with the compile command. But it also cleans up other things we need for
        reliable code intelligence:

        - Some targets may not be valid C/C++ compile commands. For example,
          some build systems will naively include build steps for Python or for
          linting commands. We want to filter those out.

        - Some compile commands don't provide a path to the compiler executable
          (referred to by clang as the "driver"). In that case, clangd is very
          unlikely to find the executable unless it happens to be in ``$PATH``.
          The ``--query-driver`` argument to ``clangd`` allowlists
          executables/drivers for use its use, but clangd doesn't use it to
          resolve ambiguous paths. We bridge that gap here. Any executable
          without a path will be either placed in the provided default path or
          searched for in the query driver globs and be replaced with a path to
          the executable.

        ``CppCompilationDatabases`` objects. In that case, we prioritize
        correctness, ensuring that the resulting compilation databases will
        work correctly with clangd. This means not including duplicate compile
        commands for the same file in the same target's database. The choice
        of which duplicate compile command ends up in the final database is
        unspecified and subject to change. Note also that this method expects
        the ``settings`` value to be the same between all of the provided
        ``CppCompilationDatabases`` objects.
