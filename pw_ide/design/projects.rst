There are broadly two types of Pigweed projects that Pigweed's IDE tooling
supports:

* Bootstrap projects, in which a development environment is populated by
  sourcing binary dependencies from CIPD, and is accessed by setting environment
  variables via ``bootstrap`` and ``activate`` shell scripts. Usually, the build
  system is GN or CMake.

* Bazel projects, in which Bazel is the build system, Bazel manages development
  environment dependencies, and the ``bazel`` (or ``bazelisk``) command is the
  entry point into all tooling

Other project configurations are possible, but these are the two that our IDE
tooling recognizes and supports.

Project structure
-----------------
For both project types, we look for the presence of a ``pigweed.json`` file to
indicate the root of the project directory.

Bootstrap projects
==================
This project structure has the following properties:

* Development tools and dependences are located in an ``environment`` directory.

.. note::

   The location and name of the ``environment`` can be actually customized when
   running ``bootstrap.sh``, and multiple independent environments are
   supported.

* Access to the development environment is provided through mutations to the
  shell environment; the ``$PATH`` is modified to point to locations in
  ``environment``, and Pigweed-specific environment variables are used to
  configure the development environment.

* A ``bootstrap.sh`` script creates the ``environment`` directory, populates it
  with development tools and dependencies, and modifies the environment of the
  shell in which the script was run to provide access to the development
  environment.

* As a side effect of the bootstrap process, an ``actions.json`` file is created
  in the ``environment`` directory that describes the mutations to the shell
  environment required to provide access to the development environment.

* Pigweed commands are made available via an executable called ``pw``.

Assuming the environment has already been bootstrapped, exposing the development
environment to an IDE or other developer tooling requires:

* Finding the ``environment`` directory, or potentially multiple ``environment``
  directories. We do this by looking for directories with an ``actions.json``
  file.

* Executing commands within a shell environment modified per the
  ``actions.json`` file. How this is done depends on the language and runtime
  of the IDE. An example in JavaScript:

.. code-block:: js

   // Assuming `actionsJson` is a parsed `actions.json` file, and `activateEnv`
   // is a function that applies the mutations described in `actionsJson` to
   // a shell environment.
   const activatedEnv = activateEnv(process.env, actionsJson);
   child_process.exec("clang", activatedEnv);

If the environment has not been bootstrapped yet, we just need to run
``bootstrap.sh``. It's not necessary to capture the mutated shell environment
that results from running the script, since we have access to it through the
steps described above.

.. _module-pw_ide-design-projects-bazel:

Bazel projects
==============
This project structure has the following properties:

* Development tools and dependences are managed by Bazel. There are multiple
  mechanisms for this, including
  `WORKSPACE <https://bazel.build/concepts/build-ref#workspace>`_ and
  `bzlmod <https://docs.bazel.build/versions/5.1.0/bzlmod.html>`_. Regardless of
  the mechanism used, Bazel manages the tools and dependencies, and their
  location on disk.

* The Bazel environment is created and updated by running a Bazel build command.

* Access to tools and commands in the development environment is provided by
  Bazel itself. In other words, the ``bazel`` executable is the entry point to
  all project operations.

So all that's required to expose the development environment to an IDE is to
execute ``bazel run`` commands.

Managing Bazel environments
---------------------------
It's important to use the version of Bazel specified by the project, and to use
a single Bazel environment and build directory regardless of the tools the
developer is using. For example, a developer should be able to edit code in
their IDE and run Bazel commands from a separate terminal and be sure that all
of those actions will execute within the same environment.

We ensure that behavior by using ``bazelisk`` instead of plain ``bazel``.
It wraps ``bazel`` and ensures that your project uses the exact version of Bazel
specified in the project's ``.bazelversion`` file.

A developer can have multiple installations of ``bazelisk`` from different
sources, and invocations of any of those executables on the same project will
all run in the same Bazel environment. So we can actually bundle ``bazelisk``
with the IDE, ensuring that it's available to IDE functionality, without
worrying about it conflicting with the developer's use of ``bazelisk`` in the
terminal or in other tools.
