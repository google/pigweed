"""Upload update bundles to a GCS bucket for signing.

This module does not implement any actual signing logic; that is left up to the
remote signing service. This module takes care of uploading bundles to GCS for
signing, waiting the signed version to appear, and downloading the signed
bundle from the output bucket. It can be used either as an entry point by
invoking it as a runnable module and providing all the necessary arguments (run
the tool with --help for details), or as a library by instantiating
RemoteSignClient and calling its sign() method.

The expected API for the remote signing service consists of the following:

    - A pair of GCS buckets. One bucket to serve as a queue of update bundles
      to be signed, and the other bucket to serve as the output area where
      signed bundles are deposited.

    - Three artifacts should be placed into the input queue bucket:
          1. The update bundle to be signed
          2. A signing request file whose name ends with "signing_request.json"
          3. A public builder key named "<signing_request_name>.public_key.pem"

Builder keys are used to generate intermediate signatures for the signing
request. Specifically, a private builder key is used to generate an
intermediate signature for both the update bundle to be signed, and the signing
request file. These signatures are then added to the GCS blob metadata for
their respective blobs. The corresponding public builder key is uploaded
alongside the signing request.

The signing service should be set up to trigger whenever a new signing request
file is added anywhere inside the input queue bucket. The signing request file
is a JSON file with the following fields:

    remote_signing_key_name: A string that should correspond to the name of a
        signing key known to the remote signing service.

    bundle_path: The path (relative to GCS input bucket root) to an update
        bundle to be signed by the remote signing service.

    bundle_public_key_path: The path (relative to GCS input bucket root) to a
        public builder key .pem file corresponding to the private builder key
        that was used to sign the update bundle and signing request file.

    output_bucket: Name of the output GCS bucket into which the remote signing
        service should place signed artifacts.

    output_path: The path (relative to the GCS output bucket root) at which the
        signed update bundle should be deposited by the remote signing service.

On the remote side, the signing service is expected to check the public builder
key against its list of allowed builder keys. Provided the key is found in the
allow list, the signing service should use it to verify the intermediate
signatures of both the update bundle to be signed and the signing request file.
If the key is not found in the allow list, or if the signature on the update
bundle or signing request file do not match the public builder key, the signing
service should reject the signing request.

If the builder public key is found in the allow list and the intermediate
signatures are verified, the signing service should produce a signed version of
the update bundle, and place it the GCS output bucket at the specified path.

In order to authenticate to GCS, the "Application Default Credentials" will be
used. This assumes remote_sign.py is running in an environment that provides
such credentials. See the Google cloud platform documentation for details:

    https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production

For development purposes, it is possible to provide an alternate method of
authenticating to GCS. The alternate authentication method should be a Python
module that is importable in the running Python environment. The module should
define a 'get_credentials()' function that takes no arguments and returns an
instance of google.auth.credentials.Credentials.
