-------
Summary
-------
This document proposes a new ``pw_channel`` module and
:cpp:class:`pw::channel::Channel` class. The module is similar to
pw_stream, with three key changes:

- Supports byte stream or datagram semantics (:ref:`module-pw_stream` is a
  subset of ``pw_channel``).
- Provides an asynchronous API (:ref:`SEED-0112`).
- Uses the :ref:`SEED-0109` buffers system, which enables zero-copy
  and vectored I/O.

``pw_channel`` will provide the data transmit and receive API for the upcoming
socket abstraction.

--------
Proposal
--------
This SEED proposes the following:

- Introduce a new ``pw_channel`` module.
- Introduce a :cpp:class:`pw::channel::Channel` virtual interface.
  Implementors of this interface may expose byte stream or datagram semantics.
  All operations in this interface are async and use :ref:`seed-0109` buffers
  to provide zero-copy operations.
- Use ``pw_channel`` as the basis for the upcoming Pigweed sockets API.
- Replace ``pw_stream`` with ``pw_channel`` to the extent possible.

----------
Motivation
----------
One of the fundamental operations of computing is sending data from one place to
another. Examples include exchanging data with

- an in-memory data structure,
- a file in a filesystem,
- a hardware peripheral,
- another process, or
- a device across a network.

There are many interfaces for data exchange. Pigweed provides
:ref:`module-pw_stream`, which is a simple synchronous API for transmitting and
receiving data. ``pw_stream``'s simple model has made it prevalent in Pigweed.

The Pigweed team is revamping its communications systems (see :ref:`seed-0107`).
The new sockets API will be a critical piece of that story. The core job of a
socket is to exchange data with another node in the network. ``pw_stream``'s
purpose is to facilitate data exchange, but it is too limited for sockets.
pw_stream is missing support for several features, including:

- Datagrams – Data is a byte stream. Datagrams are not supported.
- Unreliability – Sockets may not guarantee delivery of data. ``pw_stream``
  assumes no data is lost if ``Write`` returns ``OK``.
- Asynchronous operations – All functions block until the operation completes.
- Zero copy operations – All reads and writes require data to be copied.
- Vectored I/O – All reads and writes use a single contiguous buffer.
- Backpressure – There is no mechanism for a stream to notify the producer that
  it needs more time to process data.

These features are fairly complex and may be exposed in a variety of ways in an
API. This SEED proposes a new ``pw_stream``-like ``Channel`` data exchange API.
``Channel`` provides a standard I/O interface with these advanced features.
Like ``pw_stream``, this API will be used anywhere data needs to be read and/or
written.

---------
Use cases
---------
pw_rpc
======
pw_rpc is a communications protocol that enables calling procedures on different
nodes (i.e. RPCs), and sharing data between them. RPCs can be sent using
pw_stream APIs, which are blocking.

Sockets
=======
Sockets are a communications channel between two endpoints in a network.
Sockets support exchanging data:

- as datagrams or a stream or bytes, and
- reliably or unreliably.

pw_stream
=========
``Channel`` should support all use cases addressed by ``pw_stream``. These
include:

- :cpp:class:`pw::stream::NullStream` -- ``NullStream`` ignores all bytes
  written to it and produces no bytes when read. This is used when no input or
  output is needed.
- :cpp:class:`pw::stream::CountingNullStream` -- Counts bytes written to it.
  Used to to determine the size of an encoded object before it is encoded to its
  final destination.
- :cpp:class:`pw::stream::MemoryReader` / :cpp:class:`pw::stream::MemoryWriter`
  -- Writes data to or reads data from a fixed, contiguous memory buffer.
  Example uses include encoding a protobuf for transport.
- :cpp:class:`pw::stream::SocketStream` -- Supports reading from and writing to
  a TCP socket.
- :cpp:class:`pw::blob_store::BlobStore::Reader` /
  :cpp:class:`pw::blob_store::BlobStore::Writer` -- ``pw_blob_store`` uses a
  stream interface for reading and writing. This is similar to a file object.

Hardware interfaces
===================
It is often necessary to exchange data with hardware I/O blocks.
The ``Channel`` API could be used to abstract communications with I/O
interfaces.

------------------
Existing solutions
------------------

pw_stream
=========
pw_stream provides for a synchronous, reliable byte-oriented stream.

See :ref:`module-pw_stream`.

C++
===
C++ provides an I/O stream family of classes.

Java
====
Java provides a hierarchy of channel classes with a variety of flavors. The
`Channel interface
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/Channel.html>`_
provides just two methods: ``isOpen()`` and ``close()``. Various I/O operations
are mixed in through different interfaces. ``Channel`` supports `byte stream
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/ByteChannel.html>`_,
`datagram
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/DatagramChannel.html>`_,
`asynchronous <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/AsynchronousChannel.html>`_, and `scatter <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/ScatteringByteChannel.html>`_/`gather <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/GatheringByteChannel.html>`_ IO.

C#
==
The C# programming language offers a stream class similar to pw_stream and the
proposed pw_channel module. It supports synchronous and asynchronous operations
on a stream of bytes.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.stream?view=net-7.0

C#’s Channel API has a different intent than pw_channel. Its purpose is to
synchronize objects between endpoints, and is somewhat different from what is
proposed here.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.channels?view=net-7.0

------------
Requirements
------------
* Support data transmission for the upcoming sockets API (:ref:`seed-0107`):

  - reliable byte stream (``SOCK_STREAM``)
  - unreliable datagram (``SOCK_DGRAM``)
  - reliable datagram (``SOCK_SEQPACKET``)

* Asynchronous operations.
* Efficient, minimally copying buffer with ``MultiBuf`` (:ref:`seed-0109`).

------
Design
------
Conceptually, a channel is a sequence of bytes or datagrams exchanged between
two endpoints. An endpoint can be anything that produces or consumes data, such
as an in-memory data structure, a file in a filesystem, a hardware peripheral,
or a network socket. Both endpoints may be ``Channel`` implementations, or the
``Channel`` may simply forward to something that provides compatible semantics,
e.g. a memory buffer or OS socket.

In Unix, "everything is a file". File descriptors provide a common I/O interface
used for everything from files to pipes to sockets to hardware devices. Channels
fill a similar role as POSIX file descriptors.

Channel semantics
=================
pw_channel will provide the data exchange API for Pigweed’s upcoming network
sockets. To this end, ``Channel`` supports the following socket semantics:

- reliable byte stream (``SOCK_STREAM``)
- unreliable datagram (``SOCK_DGRAM``)
- reliable datagram (``SOCK_SEQPACKET``)

Reliability and data type (stream versus datagram) are essential aspects of
channel semantics. These properties affect how code that uses the APIs is
written. A channel with different semantics cannot be swapped for another
without updating the assumptions in the surrounding code.

Data type: datagrams & byte streams
-----------------------------------
Fundamentally, a channel involves sending data from one endpoint to another.
The endpoints might both be ``Channel`` instances (e.g. two sockets). Or, one
endpoint could be a ``Channel`` while the other is an in-memory data structure,
file in a file system, or hardware peripheral.

The data type dictates the basic unit of data transmission. Datagram channels
send and receive datagrams: "self-contained, independent entit[ies] of data"
(`RFC 1594 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1594.txt>`_). Datagrams contain a
payload of zero or more bytes. pw_channel does not define a maximum payload size
for datagrams.

Byte stream channels send and receive an arbitrary sequence of bytes.
Zero-length byte stream writes are no-ops and may not result in any bytes being
transmitted.

In terms of the channels API, ``Read``, ``Write``, and ``Seek`` functions have
different meanings for byte and and datagram channels. For byte stream channels,
these functions work with an arbitrary number of bytes. For datagram channels,
``Read``, ``Write``, and ``Seek`` are in terms of datagrams.

Reliable channels
-----------------
Reliable channels guarantee that their data is received in order and without
loss. The API user does not have to do anything to ensure this. After a write is
accepted, the user will never have to retry it. Reads always provide data in
order without loss. The channel implementation is responsible for this.

For some channels, reliability is trivial; for others it requires significant
work:

- A memory channel that writes to a buffer is trivially reliable.
- A socket communicating across a network will require a complex protocol such
  as TCP to guarantee that the data is delivered.

Initially, only reliable byte-oriented channels will be supported. Unreliable
byte streams are not commonly supported, and would be difficult to apply in many
use cases. There are circumstances where unreliable byte streams do makes sense,
such as reading time-sensitive sensor data, where the consumer only wants the
very latest data regardless of drops. Unreliable byte streams may be added in
the future.

Data loss
^^^^^^^^^
Data is never silently lost in a reliable channel. Unrecoverable data loss
always results in the eventual closure of the channel, since a fundamental
invariant of the channel cannot be maintained.

A few examples:

- A write to a TCP channel fails because of a transient hardware issue. The
  channel and underlying TCP connection are closed.
- A TCP channel times out on a retry. The channel and underlying TCP connection
  are closed.
- A write to a channel that fills a ring buffer is requested. A ``MultiBuf`` for
  the write is not provided immediately because the ring buffer is full. The
  channel stays open, but the write is delayed until the ring buffer has
  sufficient space.

Reliability & connections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Reliable channels operate as if they have a connection, even if the underlying
implementation does not establish a connection. This specifically means that:

- It is assumed that the peer endpoint will receive data for which the write
  call succeeded.
- If data is lost, the error will be reported in some form and the channel will
  be closed.

For example, a TCP socket channel would maintain an explicit connection, while a
ring buffer channel would not.

Unreliable channels
-------------------
Unreliable datagram channels make no guarantees about whether datagrams are
delivered and in what order they arrive. Users are responsible for tracking
drops and ordering if required.

Unreliable channels should report read and write failures whenever possible,
but an ``OK`` write does not indicate that the data is received by the other
endpoint.

Flow control, backpressure, and ``ConservativeLimit``
=====================================================
A channel may provide backpressure through its async write API. The
``PollWritable`` method should be used to ensure that the channel is ready
to receive calls to ``Write``. Additionally, the ``MultiBufAllocator`` may wait
to provide a ``MultiBuf`` for writing until memory becomes available.

pw_stream offered a notion of flow control through the
:cpp:func:`pw::stream::Stream::ConservativeWriteLimit` function. Code using a
stream could check the write limit prior to writing data to determine if the
stream is ready to receive more. This function will not be provided in
``pw_channel``.

Openness / closedness
=====================
pw_channel will have an explicit open/closed concept that ``pw_stream`` lacks.
Reads and writes may succeed when the channel is open. Reads and writes never
succeed when the channel is closed.

The channel API supports closing a channel, but does not support opening a
channel. Channels are opened by interacting with a concrete class.

Reliable channels are closed if unrecoverable data loss occurs. Unreliable
channels may be closed when reads or writes are known to fail (e.g. a
cable was unplugged), but this is not required.

Synchronous APIs
================
The ``pw_channel`` class may provide synchronous versions of its functions,
implementated in terms of the asynchronous API. These will poll the asynchronous
API until it completes, blocking on a binary semaphore or similar primitive if
supported. This will leverage a ``pw_async`` helper for this purpose.

Channel Class Capabilities
==========================
``Channel`` s may offer any of five capabilities:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Capability
     - Description
   * - ``kReliable``
     - Data is guaranteed to arrive in order, without loss.
   * - ``kSeekable``
     - The read/write position may be changed via the ``Seek`` method.
   * - ``kDatagram``
     - Data is guaranteed to be received in whole packets matching the size and
       contents of a single ``Write`` call.
   * - ``kReadable``
     - Supports reading data.
   * - ``kWritable``
     - Supports writing data

These capabilities are expressed as generic arguments to the ``Channel`` class,
e.g. ``Channel<kReadable | kReliable>`` for a ``Channel`` that is readable and
reliable. Aliases are provided for common combinations, such as ``ByteStream``
for a reliable non-seekable non-datagram stream of bytes (such as a TCP stream).
Certain nonsensical combinations, such as a channel that is ``kSeekable`` but
not ``kReadable`` or ``kWritable`` are disallowed via ``static_assert``.

Conversion
----------
Channels may be freely converted to channels with fewer capabilities, e.g.
``Channel<kReadable | kWritable>`` may be used as a ``Channel<kReadable>``.
This allows Channels with compatible semantics to be substituted for one another
safely.

Shared Base Class for Minimal Code Size
---------------------------------------
``Channel`` also inherits from an ``AnyChannel`` base class which provides the
underlying ``virtual`` interface.  Sharing a single base class avoids multiple
inheritance, minimizing vtable overhead.

Prototype Demonstrating Channel Capabilities
--------------------------------------------
A prototype demonstrating this interface can be seen `here
<https://godbolt.org/z/3c4M3Y17r>_`.

API sketch
==========
An outline of the ``AnyChannel`` base class follows. ``AnyChannel`` will rarely
be used directly, since it makes no guarantees about any channel capabilities or
the data type. The function signatures and comments apply to all derived classes,
however.

pw_channel and pw_stream
========================
As described, ``pw_channel`` is closely based on ``pw_stream``. It adds async,
``MultiBuf``, and new socket-inspired semantics.

``pw_channel`` is intended to supersede ``pw_stream``. There are a few options
for how to reconcile the two modules. From most to least ideal, these are:

- Fully replace ``pw_stream`` with ``pw_channel`` and remove the ``pw_stream``
  module.
- Rework ``pw_stream`` so it inherits from ``pw::channel::Channel``.
- Keep ``pw_stream``, but provide adapters to convert between ``pw_stream`` and
  ``pw_channel``.

Fully replacing ``pw_stream`` with ``pw_channel`` could be complicated due to:

- Potential code size increase because of ``MultiBuf`` and the async poll model.
- The scale of migrating the all Pigweed users off of ``pw_stream``.
- Increased API complexity imposing a burden on Pigweed users.
