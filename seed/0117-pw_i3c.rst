Summary
-------
A new peripheral protocol, I3C (pronounced eye-three-see) was introduced to
electronic world and it has been widely accepted by SoC and sensor
manufacturers. This seed is to propose a new front-end library pw_i3c, to help
communicate with devices on I3C bus.

----------
Motivation
----------
Though widely used, I²C peripheral bus has several significant shortages, for
example the low bus speed, extra physical line to carry interrupt from each
device on the I²C bus, etc. To cope with higher requirements and to address
shortages of I²C, MIPI proposed a new fast, low-power and two-wire peripheral
protocol, I3C.

I3C could be regarded as improved I²C. But in the meantime, it is a new protocol
which is different to I²C in both hardware and software. Some important
differences include:

1. I3C SDA uses open-drain mode when necessary for legacy I²C compatibility,
   but switches to push-pull outputs whenever possible.
2. I3C SCL runs in only in pull-pull mode and can only be driven by I3C
   initiator.
3. I3C devices supports dynamic address assignment (DAA) and has higher address
   requirements.
4. I3C needs bus initialization and DAA before it is ready to use.
5. I3C has a standardized command set, called common command codes (CCC).
6. I3C supports In-Band interrupt and hot-join.
7. I3C device is identified by a 48-bit Provisioned ID (Manufacturer ID + Part
   ID + Instance ID).

In conclusion, it is worth providing an independent library pw_i3c to help
initialize I3C initiator and communicate with I3C devices on the bus.

--------------------------
Proposal (Detailed design)
--------------------------
Since I3C is very similar to I²C, following proposal is to create a standalone
library pw_i3c, which shares a similar structure as pw_i2c.

device type
-----------

The ``DeviceType`` is used to help differentiate legacy I²C devices and I3C
devices on one I3C bus.

.. code-block:: c++

   enum class DeviceType : bool {
     kI2c,
     kI3c,
   };

Address
-------

The ``Address`` is a helper class to represent addresses which are used by
``pw_i3c`` APIs. In I3C protocol, addresses are differentiated by I²C (static)
address and I3C (active or dynamic) address. The reason why device type is
embedded into address is that transactions for I²C and I3C devices are
different. So ``Initiator`` could tell the device type just by the provided
``Address`` object.

Apart from creating and checking ``Address`` at compile time, a helper
constructor to create and check ``Address`` at runtime is created, with
following reasons:

1. A new active/dynamic address could be assigned to I3C devices at run time.
2. New devices could hot-join the bus at run time.

.. code-block:: c++

   class Address {
    public:
     static constexpr uint8_t kHotJoinAddress = 0x02;
     static constexpr uint8_t kBroadcastAddress = 0x7E;
     static constexpr uint8_t kStaticMaxAddress = 0x7F;
     // For I3C, the active (dynamic) address restriction is dynamic (depending
     // on devices on the bus, details can be found in "MIPI I3C Basic
     // Specification Version 1.1.1" chapter 5.1.2.2.5). But to simplify the
     // design, the strictest rule is applied. And there will be 108 addresses
     // free for dynamic address chosen.
     static constexpr uint8_t kDynamicMinAddress = 0x08;
     static constexpr uint8_t kDynamicMaxAddress = 0x7D;

     // Helper constructor to ensure the address fits in the address space at
     // compile time, skipping the construction time assert.
     template <DeviceType kDeviceType, uint8_t kAddress>
     static constexpr Address Create() {
       static_assert(!IsOutOfRange(kDeviceType, kAddress));
       static_assert((DeviceType::kI2c == kDeviceType) ||
                     !SingleBitErrorDetection(kAddress));
       return Address{kDeviceType, kAddress};
     }

     // Helper constructor to create the address at run time.
     // Returns std::nullopt if provided type and address does not fit address
     // rules.
     static constexpr std::optional<Address> Create(
         DeviceType device_type, uint8_t address) {
       if (IsOutOfRange(device_type, address)) {
         return std::nullopt;
       }
       if (DeviceType::kI3c == device_type && SingleBitErrorDetection(address)) {
         return std::nullopt;
       }
       return Address{type, address};
     }

     // Return the type of address.
     constexpr DeviceType GetType() const;

     // Return the address.
     constexpr uint8_t GetAddress() const;

    private:
     static constexpr uint8_t kAddressMask = 0x7F;
     static constexpr int kTypeShift = 7;
     static constexpr uint8_t kTypeMask = 0x01;

     constexpr Address(DeviceType type, uint8_t address)
         : packed_address_{Pack(type, address)} {}

     uint8_t packed_address_;
   };

Ccc
---

Common Command Codes are categorized into broadcast(Command Codes from 0x00 to
0x7F) and direct(Command Codes from 0x80 to 0xFE). The rational behind it is
broadcast CCC can only be write and is executed in one transaction, but direct
CCC can be both write and read, and is executed in two transactions. We can
eliminate extra CCC type check in initiator CCC API.

.. code-block:: c++

   enum class CccBroadcast : uint8_t {
     kEnc = 0x00,
     kDisec = 0x01,
     kEntdas0 = 0x02,
     ...
     kSetxtime = 0x28,
     kSetaasa = 0x29,
   }

   enum class CccDirect : uint8_t {
     kEnc = 0x80,
     kDisec = 0x81,
     kEntas0 = 0x82,
     ...
     kSetxtime = 0x98,
     kGetxtime = 0x99,
   };

   inline constexpr uint8_t kCccDirectBit = 7;

   enum class CccAction : bool {
     kWrite,
     kRead,
   };

Initiator
---------

.. inclusive-language: disable

Similar as ``pw::i2c``, ``Initiator`` is the common, base driver interface for
initiating thread-safe transactions with devices on an I3C bus. Other
documentation may call this style of interface an “master”, “central”, or
“controller”.

.. inclusive-language: enable

The main difference by comparison with I²C, is I3C initiator needs a bus
initialization and dynamic address assignment (DAA) step, before it is fully
functional. And after first bus initialization, I3C initiator should be able to
do bus re-initialization anytime when the bus is free. However, different
backend implementations may deal with this part differently. For example, Linux
does not expose I3C bus to userspace, which means users cannot control bus
initialization. NXP Mcuxpresso SDK exposes I3C as a pure library to users, so it
is users' responsibility to initialize the bus and perform DAA to get a usable
initiator. Zephyr provides more functions than Linux regarding I3C, which
makes I3C usage in Zephyr looks more likely to NXP Mcuxpresso SDK.

Considering the complexity of different backend implementations of I3C bus, it
is better to have an "Initiator Maker" to take care of making an I3C
``Initiator``. And this is not considered in the first version of ``pw_i3c``
design.

.. code-block:: c++

   // PID is the unique identifier to an I3C device.
   struct Pid {
     uint16_t manuf_id = 0;
     uint16_t part_id = 0;
     uint16_t instance_id = 0;

     friend constexpr bool operator==(Pid const& lhs, Pid const& rhs) {
       return (lhs.manuf_id == rhs.manuf_id) && (lhs.part_id == rhs.part_id) &&
              (lhs.instance_id == rhs.instance_id);
     }
     friend constexpr bool operator!=(Pid const& lhs, Pid const& rhs) {
       return (lhs.manuf_id != rhs.manuf_id) || (lhs.part_id != rhs.part_id) ||
              (lhs.instance_id != rhs.instance_id);
     }

    // Concat manuf_id, part_id and instance_id to a pid in 64-bit.
    constexpr uint64_t AsUint64(Pid const pid) {
      return (static_cast<uint64_t>(pid.manuf_id) << 33) |
             (static_cast<uint64_t>(pid.part_id) << 16) |
             (static_cast<uint64_t>(pid.instance_id) << 12);
    }

    // Split a 64-bit pid into manuf_id, part_id and instance_id (struct Pid).
    static constexpr Pid FromUint64(const uint64_t pid) {
      return Pid{
          .manuf_id = ExtractBits<uint16_t, 47, 33>(pid),
          .part_id = ExtractBits<uint16_t, 31, 16>(pid),
          .instance_id = ExtractBits<uint16_t, 15, 12>(pid)};
    }

  };

  // I3C supports in-band interrupt (IBI), but generalize the name to cover
  // traditional interrupts.
  // For IBI, the argument can be used to store data transferred.
  // If the handler is queued in a workqueue, the data could be of any length.
  // If the handler is executed inside CPU ISR directly, the data should only
  // be mandatory data byte.

Device
------

Same as ``pw::i2c::Device``, a ``Device`` class is used in ``pw::i3c`` to
write/read arbitrary chunks of data over a bus to a specific device, or perform
other I3C operations, e.g. direct CCC.
Though PID is the unique identifier for I3C devices, considering backward
compatibility with I²C devices, this object also wraps the Initiator API with
an active ``Address``. Application should initiate or be notified the
``Address`` change and update the ``Address`` in ``Device`` object.

Alternatives
------------
Since I3C is similar to I²C and pw_i3c is similar to pw_i2c, instead of creating
a standalone library, an alternative solution is to combine pw_i3c and pw_i2c,
and providing a single library pw_ixc, or other suitable names. And in this
comprehensive library, I3C-related features could be designed to be optional.

On one hand, this solution could reuse a lot of code and simplify some work in
user level, if users want to abstract usage of I²C and I3C in application.
On the other hand, it also brings churn to existing projects using pw_i2c, and
ambiguity and confusion in the long run (I²C is mature, but I3C is new and
actively improving).

Open Questions
--------------
1. As mentioned in the description of I3C ``Initiator`` class, the creation of a
   fully functional ``Initiator`` would be handled by a different class.

2. Because there are two types of ``Address`` in I3C, the static and dynamic,
   the ``pw::i3c::Address`` is not compatible with ``pw::i2c::Address``. So when
   users try to create an ``Address`` for an I²C device, they need to carefully
   choose the correct class depending on which bus the device is connected to.
   This class may cause bigger concern if ``Address`` is needed to be shared
   through interface in application code.
   But the problem is resolvable by templating ``Address`` in caller code.
   Also, we can have a helper function in ``pw::i3c::Address``, which consumes a
   ``pw::i2c::Addres``s and create a ``pw::i3c::Address``. This helper will be
   added and discussed further in a following patch.

3. ``DeviceType`` is embedded into ``Address``. So ``pw::i3c::Initiator`` could
   tell the device type (I²C or I3C) based on provided ``Address``. But this is
   not necessary because Initiator has performed DAA during initialization so it
   should know which addresses have been assigned to I3C devices.
   In this case, the only advantage of this design is to help applying address
   restriction during creating ``Address`` object. Should address restriction be
   taken care of by HAL? Though fewer, I²C has reserved addresses, too, but they
   are not checked in ``pw::i2c::Address``.

4. ``RegisterDevice`` for I3C is the same as I²C, in protocol. To read/write
   from a register, the ``Initiator`` sends an active address on the bus. Once
   acknowledged, it will send the register address followed by data.
   So the ideal design is to abstract ``RegisterDevice`` across I²C and I3C, or
   maybe even other peripheral buses (e.g. SPI and DSI). However, the underlying
   register operation functions are different. It is better to be handled in a
   separate SEED.
